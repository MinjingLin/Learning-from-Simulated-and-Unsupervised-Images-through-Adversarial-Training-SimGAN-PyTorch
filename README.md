# Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training (SimGAN, PyTorch)
This repository is a work in progress and is updated regularly. Documentation and usage may be unclear right now, any questions or concerns are welcome!.

This repository is an implementation of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07828) in PyTorch. Many of the repositories I found that were also written in PyTorch either were (1) buggy or (2) incomplete. This repository modifies other repos and makes this implementation more complete and hopefully easier to use. 

## Motivation
[This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07828) presents a method to add realism to unreal or synthetic data, allowing us to train on a labeled set of synthetic data that matches the distribution of realistic data 'better,' resulting in better testing accuracy. Finish later.


## Overview
What is this project. What does it do? How does it work? Fix image sizes. Give brief explanations to the project. Fix later.

## Build status
In development! Documentation and usage information is currently being uploaded. More detailed results will be added eventually.

## Results
Columns 1, 3, 5 and 7 are the input syntheric images (Unity Eyes). <br/>
Columns 2, 4, 6 and 8 are the refined images (Unity Eyes + Realism)

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.
... Going to include docker files ... Fix later.

## Usage
If people like your project theyâ€™ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.
Include links to the sub READMEs in the gaze_estimator and simgan folders. Fix later.

[This is the link to the gaze_estimator README with instructions on usage](/gaze_estimator/README.md)

[This is the link to the simgan README with instructions on usage](/simgan/README.md)

## Contribute
Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus. Fix later.

## Credits
Give proper credits. This could be a link to any repo which inspired you to build this project, any blogposts or links to people who contrbuted in this project. Fix later.

[This is the paper that this repo is based off of](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07828)
This repo is largely based on [this guys repo](https://github.com/automan000/SimGAN_PyTorch) but I fixed some of the bugs and reorganized the code so that it is hopefully easier to use.
